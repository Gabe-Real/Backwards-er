# Backwards-er

Or should maybe be known as "re-sdrawkcaB" hehe is a project I thew together in about 5 minutes... why you ask?

If you want to use this for some reason then feel free to or whatever ¯\\__(ツ)_/¯

Also if you want to play with it just run the [run_reverse.bat](/src/run_reverse.bat) file in a folder and it will open up windows powershell idk if it supports linux for all you nerds out there lmao
